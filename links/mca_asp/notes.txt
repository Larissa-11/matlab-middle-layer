MATLAB Channel Access Toolbox (MCA) consists of
one main mex-file (mcamain.dll compiled from mcamain.cpp)
and a number of m-file aliases to it

You can learn about each of these aliases using

CONFIGURATION

Add the location of CA DLL's (Ca.dll, Com.dll) to the system path
For example
... ;Q:\Groups\Accel\Controls\Epics\R3.13.4\base\bin\Win32; ...


Add the MCA directory to the MATLAB path (Menu-File-Set Path)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recomiling mex-files

MCA mex-files (mca.dll and timereval.dll) are compiled from
mca.cpp and timereval.cpp. I use MSVC++ 6.0 compiler.

If you need to recompile them, the best way is to use MATLAB 'mex' command
You will need to 'cd' to the MCA root directory.
Examine the 'mexcommand' script included with MCA - it has all the right options.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The use of Windows System Timers extends the asynchronous
capabilities of MATLAB and MCA. It is done with another
mex-file (timereval.dll compiled from timereval.cpp)
You could write your own m-file aliases with self-explanatory names

The matlab syntax is:

timereval(switch,delay,callbackstring)
When 'switch' is 1 or 2, timereval sets the windows system timer to execute 
a callback in MATLAB
1 - single shot
2 - periodic

delay: 
delay or period in ms

callbackstring: MATLAB command string that will be executed 
                as if typed at the MATLAB prompt 


When 'switch' is 4, 
timereval prints in MATLAB command window the information about all running timers:
handles and callback strings
timereval(4);

When 'switch' is 5 - timereval(5,TimerHandle) kills a specific timer 
given by its handle 


EXAMPLES:

1. Schedule a command to execute in 3 seconds
>> TimerHandle1 = timereval(1,3000,'disp Hello');


2. Display current time every second
>> TimerHandle2 = timereval(2,1000,'disp(datestr(now))'); 

Notice that you still have a working command prompt.
Try, what happens when you call a MATLAB function that 
takes longer than 1 second, for example:
M = rand(200);
E = eig(M);  

3. Print info.
>> timereval(4);

4. To stop a particular timer:
>> timereval(5,TimerHandle2);


5. when you clear the timereval mex-file from memory with
>> clear timereval
it first clears all timers. 


6. Use of timereval inside CA monitor callbacks:
CA monitor callbacks run one at a time to completion.
It implies that a monitor callback function itself may 
contain other CA library calls. For example you can not install
a monitor on PV A with a callback that writes a value to
another PV B.

THIS WOULD NOT WORK: mcamon(HandleA,'mcaput(HandleB,0)')

timereval allows you to schedule the desired CA call to
execute after the monitor callback is finished:

>> mcamon(HandleA,'timereval(1,10,''mcaput(HandleB,0)'')')

In this example the put operation will occur 10 ms after the monitor event
